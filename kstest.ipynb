    "Disk-hosting galaxies (spirals or lenticulars) that exhibit large-scale radio emission are extremely rare and under-researched. Within our broader, unpublished research project, we have collated every currently known disk-hosting radio galaxy in the Universe (n=34) together to analyse as a population. One of these analyses was the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. This is a powerful statistical test that allows the underlying probability distributions of different datasets to be investigated and compared. When conducting this test, we aim to discern whether the currently known sample of disk-hosting radio galaxies exhibits statistical similarities or differences when compared to the extensive samples of other types of radio galaxies; ellipticals, FR-Is, FR-IIs and Seyferts. This notebook documents the process of conducting this analysis. "

For each of these studies, we calculated two crucial metrics, the largest linear size (LLS, in kpc) and radio power at 325MHz (in W/Hz), for the identified galaxies. These data were organised into text files, which are subsequently loaded in the following code segment. Specifically, the code extracts LLS and power values from the text files, creating separate arrays for each study. \n",
